# MasterThesis_Codes

This repository contains the different codes used for the master thesis (except the basic codes that just plot data ), the original data from which everythings was derived (experiment.pcap) and some of the data already transformed to be able to test de codes.

The different codes are : 
  - The codes for the sensors and the server ( ClientMot , ClientTemp, Server)
  - The code that plot the days that we compare ( PlotDays ) 
  - The code that separate a CSV file into columns ( TransfoCSV)
  - The code that do a periodigram to check the periodicity ( periodigram)
  - The code that withdraw the Temperature sensor data ( TempFilter)
  - The code that compute the probabilities of the different scenarios ( automaticdetection)
